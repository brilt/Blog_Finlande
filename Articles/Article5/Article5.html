        <h2>It's not because we started the courses that we stopped doing activities!  </h2>
        <h2>Ice Fishing:  </h2>

            Indeed, Ines, Emma and I went to a fishing activity on a frozen lake organised by our university. 
            We left on 12/03 in the morning around 10am and we came back around 5pm. 
            We had an hour bus ride to get to a lake. Once we arrived, we were welcomed by our "guide" who taught us how to line fish on the ice. 
            He also showed us how to fish with a net. The activity was quite fun to do, especially the ice drilling part, after that you have to be patient! 
            Some fishes were caught! Not by us unfortunately but we didn't stay long because we went to eat and then we went to a sauna. 
            I personally didn't participate to the sauna because I didn't take my stuff. 
            But Ines and Emma could, and they even took the opportunity to go swimming in the frozen lake! 
            It was a really nice day. We were able to discover many things and make lots of unforgettable memories!

          <h2>Hockey:</h2>
          <article>  
            Hockey is the most popular sport in Finland and the sport with the largest audience along with Formula 1. 
            Some of us were able to attend a hockey match in Seinäjoki and more matches are planned so we all hope to be able to attend matches. 
            The big plus to remember during Hockey games is the incredible atmosphere in the stadium!

          <h2>Bike:</h2>

          <article>  
            You can go cycling, even if there is snow or ice everywhere. I walked (about 30 min) to a shop specialised in selling or renting bikes. 
            And for 25€ I was able to rent an electric bike, with tyres adapted to the snow, for the day. 
            Afterwards, you are free to ride where you want, for my part I went to the lake Kyrkösjärvi where I could ride on the ice and on the paths around the lake before stopping and having a picnic.

            I really enjoyed cycling during the snowy period, I can't wait for the sun and summer to arrive (in May) so I can ride my bike on a hot, sunny day.  
            And I don't know if it's possible yet, but I'd love to go swimming in the lake during a bike ride. Maybe you'll see it all coming soon on the blog!
            During my bike ride I noticed that a lot of Finnish people do cross-country skiing because we met them everywhere. I couldn't try cross-country skiing when there was snow, it's a shame!
