      <h1>Trip to Finland</h1>
      <article>
        <p>Hi, my name is Killian Boisseau, I’m a French student at Esaip which is an engineering school at Angers. Thanks to Esaip, my friends and I have the chance to do our Erasmus at Seinäjoki in Finland.</p>
      <p>
        Once we knew that we would go to Finland we searched for ways to travel there. We found 2 different airlines that could take us to Finland: 
        -	Ryanair: a low-cost airline. Its planes leave from Paris-Beauvais and it’s cheaper than Finnair
        -	Finnair: the national Finnish airline. Its planes leave from Paris Charles De Gaulle.
        Ines and I decided to go for Finnair whereas Thomas and Emma went for Ryanair. We took Finnair because we wanted a less stressful trip: we just had to take a train from Angers directly to the Airport! We just had to wait there for the plane. 
      </p>  
      <p>
        If we had taken Ryanair, we would have to find an Airbnb or a Hotel at Paris Beauvais because there was no train that could take us in time to the airport.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, we chose Finnair and a flight taking off at 3:00 pm and landing at Helsinki at 4:00 pm (local time so +1h than in France). We booked a train from Angers to Paris CDG to arrive at 11am at the airport to make sure we had time (and because there was no other train).
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we received a mail telling us that our flight had been cancelled! It’s my first time taking a flight and it’s cancelled… How unlucky can we be? We didn’t choose the low-cost airline to make sure nothing bad would happen. Well, it’s too late, we decided to take another flight the same day and taking off at 7pm and landing a 11pm local time. We didn’t change our train because it was too expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The departure day has arrived! We went to Angers’ train station and took the train. After 3 hours we arrived at Paris Charles De Gaulle. I’ve never been there, it’s huge. We had an 8 hour wait for the plane, so we walked in the airport, looking for good seats. We found some with electrical outlets, perfect to watch series without worrying about discharged phones!
      </p>
      <p>
        After about 7 hours we went to the check-in station to get our ticket. Then, we went to the security check where our suitcases were scanned in case we had weapons. After, we arrived at the duty-free area where you can buy food, alcohol and we decided to buy Jeager and Get27 because we know that alcohol is expensive in Finland.
      </p>
      <p>
        7pm arrived fast and we got to the plane, I was excited because it was my first time being in a plane! It started moving and here we go for 3 hours in the air, leaving France. It was night so we couldn’t see that much outside, but big cities were illuminated!
      </p>
      <p>
        We landed after 3 hours. The airport is smaller than Paris’. We had to get back our checked baggage, but we got lost in the airport. After 15min of walking we finally found our baggage. The next step was to find our hotel. We found airport’s employees and they helped us finding the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had to walk for 15 min to get into the hotel. After a night at the hotel, we went back to the airport to take a train to Seinäjoki. We looked at the white landscape and watched series during 3 hours until we arrived at Seinäjoki where someone was waiting for us…
      </p>
      <p>
        The story continues next week.
