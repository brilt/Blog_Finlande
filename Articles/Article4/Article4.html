      <h1>Our trip to Lapland, part 2!</h1>

          Probably the most amazing day of this little trip to Lapland!!! We went snowmobiling!
           It was an absolutely breathtaking experience in beautiful landscapes!
            The pleasure of the speed of a sport considered as extreme combined with the beauty of Lapland was an incredible combo! 
            This trip was the most expensive but it was worth the price. The ride lasted 3 hours, including a part of the night ride at -26°C. 
            We then finished the day with a small game night during which we laughed a lot.

            The next day we went to a dog sledding farm and enjoyed a 30 min ride in a dog sled extremely expensive (110€) but very pleasant. 
            After the ride we had the opportunity to spend some time with the dogs and puppies while sipping a berry tea, it was very chill. 
            The sky was beautiful that day and the dogs were very affectionate. As we had some time before the bus we explored the surroundings, 
            there were some beautiful draught horses.

            After lunch we visited the museum of Rovaniemi, it was an interesting moment and the calmness that reigned there was very appreciable.
             In the evening we hired a guide (very expensive) to take us to see the Northern Lights. Unfortunately, the weather conditions were not favorable, 
             the sky was very cloudy and we could not admire any. But we enjoyed the evening chatting, drinking tea, eating reindeer sausage, corn and marshmallows around a fire.
              The evening was pleasant although very cold (-22°C) and accompanied by the smoke of the fire which was burning our eyes. Our guide was very nice and took pictures of us!

            We went skiing! We got up early and were surprised to arrive at a resort ... deserted! The resort was small but we spent the day there and it was very nice!
             I was able to improve my skiing skills and we even did some off-piste skiing! The highest pass of the resort opened in the afternoon and we were surprised
              to discover a breathtaking view! After this very sportive day we had to walk 45 min under a heavy snow to get back to the apartment because we missed the last bus! 
              As it was our last evening in Rovaniemi we enjoyed it a lot! I could test the sauna of the apartment and it really made me feel good.

            Day of the big departure! We went back to Seinäjoki but before that we had to go again to the station! This moment was without any doubt the most unpleasant of
             the stay because we had to drag our suitcases in fresh snow by -9°C during about thirty minutes. My suitcase wheels froze and was not able to roll anymore... 
             Once at the station, Rémi, Inès and myself went to eat at the restaurant while waiting for our train 2 hours later. The meal was very good! Then we finally took 
             the return trains. The first one at 3:35pm took us to Oulu at 6pm where we had to change train to Seinäjoki. We arrived in Seinäjoki station at about 9pm.
