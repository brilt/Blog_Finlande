      <h1>The arrival to Seinäjoki, a rocky start!</h1>
      <article>

          <pre>As soon as we arrived and checked that we had all our belongings, we started looking for a girl with blue hair and black overalls. This girl is Ella, our tutor from the university. As an exchange student at SeAMK university, we could all ask to be assigned a student as our tutor. We got really lucky to have Ella, she really helped us a lot, as you’ll see in this article. 
            The first thing she helped us with -and it’s not the easiest one, believe me- was carrying our heavy luggage on the snowy pavements. 
            To start with, she accompanied us to the Sevas office to get the keys of our apartment. (Sevas is the company which manages the apartments most exchange student chose.)
            Afterwards, we went straight to our apartment as we were really excited to see what it looked like, and scared of what equipment it had. We had been told that the equipment we were sure to have were a bed, a pillow, a table and some chairs. The rest is a lottery. An Esaip student had told us that depending on what the former tenant left and sold, we might have to buy nearly everything, even dishes. Fortunately, we had a lot of things already there, way more than I was expecting to be honest. My first impression when we arrived was that it was bigger than I had imagined it to be and everything was in good condition. I was -and still am- very happy with the apartment! I have a very nice view from my bedroom and even a few decorative objects left by the previous tenants. But the best part was… THE CHOCOLATE! The previous students left a chocolate bar in each of our bedroom and a hidden note with their name and Instagram account. (one of them was also from Esaip!)
            Ella accompanied us to the supermarket to show us the city and help us understand what the products were. As good French people we bought some cheese, and as good students we bought some pasta.
            We then got home and started to unpack everything.
            There is a particularity about these apartments that I didn’t tell you about. Your door locks itself when you close it. Therefore, you must be really careful not to leave your key in your room and close the door. But who would make such a mistake on their first day, right after their tutor warned them about it? Well, me, of course. As soon as I realised what I had done, Killian and I started trying to figure out a solution. Our best idea was to go from Killian’s balcony to my balcony, as I had left the window open and my key close enough to grab it from outside. The only issue was that it would mean that we would have to climb over the fence and hang over nothing, on the second floor. As none of us wanted to break something on our first day, we called our superhero of the story: Ella. Ella made several phone calls for me and, thanks to her, two people came to open my door. It did cost me 20€, but at least I had a bed to sleep in for the weekend.
